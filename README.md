# structural-ai-evaluation
Evaluation frameworks and probe templates for detecting structural failure modes in LLM and multi-agent systems — including invariant violations, constraint drift, and global incoherence despite local correctness. Designed as a foundation for durable, programmatic evaluation tooling.
This repository is an evolving framework. Contributions and discussion are welcome.
